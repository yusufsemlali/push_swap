# Push_Swap

This is a project that sorts data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. The project includes two programs - `push_swap` and `checker`. The `push_swap` program calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a C language compiler (like gcc) installed on your system to build and run this project.

### Building

To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run the `make` command:

```bash
cd push_swap
make
```

This will compile the source files and create two executable files - `push_swap` and `checker`.

### Running

To run the `push_swap` program, use the following command:

```bash
./push_swap [list of integers]
```

To run the `checker` program, use the following command:

```bash
./checker [list of integers]
```
